## As a developer, you have taken on a client who is looking to open a small business. Your client wants your advice as well as your developer skills.

# Help your client decide on what kind of small business to open.
# Create a rough draft of a website your client can use to share information about their new business.
<!-- Landing Page:
Use the landing page to introduce the Liquor Store.
    Include a welcome message, a brief description of the Liquor Store, and an image.
Additional Pages:
    Menu Page:
        Display a list of liquor and snack items available at the Liquor Store.
        Include prices and images if possible.
    Events Page:
        Announce upcoming events.
    Contact Page:
        Provide contact information for the Liquor Store, including address, phone number, and email. -->
# The website should have a landing page and at least three additional pages with useful information.
# The website should be user friendly with navigation between all appropriate pages.
# The website landing page should appear at localhost:3000

## üíª Params Challenges

## Create a controller called Main to complete the following challenges. Each challenge will have its own controller method, route, and view file.
# Create a page called cubed that takes one number as a param and displays that number cubed.
# Create a page called evenly that takes two numbers as params and displays whether or not the first number is evenly divisible by the second.
# Create a page called palindrome that takes a string as a param and displays whether it is a palindrome (the same word forward and backward) or not.
# Create a page called random that takes two numbers as params and displays a random number from within the inclusive range of the two numbers.
# Create a page called madlib that takes at least three params that are different parts of speech (noun, pronoun, verb, adjective, adverb) and displays a short silly story.
# Hint: Use AI to generate the story!

## üèî Stretch Goals

# Implement error handling in each controller to check if the required parameters are present. Display a custom error message in the view if parameters are missing.
# Add styling to your pages using the file app/assets/stylesheets/application.css. There is no need to import your stylesheet, Rails handles all of that for you.
